## Interval Booking Automation with Selenium and Twilio 🚀

This project automates the booking process for customer service shifts at 'Company I work for', using Selenium in Python. It's designed to book shifts within specific day 📅 and time ranges 🕒 and notify the user via SMS using Twilio 📲 upon successful bookings.

### 🌟 Features:

- **Automated Booking:** Efficiently navigates through booking pages to reserve shifts. 🤖
  
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Books shifts based on predefined day 📆 and time ranges ⏰.

- **Real-time Notifications:** Sends SMS notifications via Twilio upon successful bookings. 📱💬

### 🛠️ How it Works:

The script uses Selenium to automate web interactions 🖥️. It logs into the booking portal, navigates to the scheduling page, and selects available shifts within the specified time range. Upon successful booking, it triggers a Twilio SMS notification 📩 to inform the user.

### 🤔 Why I Built This:

I created this tool for personal use to streamline the process of booking shifts, saving time and effort. It demonstrates my skills in automation, web scraping, and integration with third-party APIs like Twilio. For instance, if I'm going out or focusing on a project 👨‍💻 or college work 📚, I can simply run this script to book intervals for tomorrow morning. Whenever a shift becomes available and is successfully booked, the script notifies me via SMS. This allows me to focus on my work or activities without constantly checking for available shifts.

**Note:** I use Firefox 🦊 for this automation to avoid interfering with my regular browsing. Using a separate browser ensures consistent and uninterrupted script execution.
