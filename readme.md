## Interval Booking Automation with Selenium and Twilio

This project automates the booking process for customer service shifts at 'Company I work for', using Selenium in Python. It's designed to book shifts within specific day and time ranges and notify the user via SMS using Twilio upon successful bookings.

### Features:

- **Automated Booking:** Efficiently navigates through booking pages to reserve shifts.
  
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Books shifts based on predefined day and time ranges.

- **Real-time Notifications:** Sends SMS notifications via Twilio upon successful bookings.

### How it Works:

The script uses Selenium to automate web interactions. It logs into the booking portal, navigates to the scheduling page, and selects available shifts within the specified time range. Upon successful booking, it triggers a Twilio SMS notification to inform the user.

### Why I Built This:

I created this tool for personal use to streamline the process of booking shifts, saving time and effort. It demonstrates my skills in automation, web scraping, and integration with third-party APIs like Twilio. For instance, if I'm going out or focusing on a project or college work, I can simply run this script to book intervals for tomorrow morning. Whenever a shift becomes available and is successfully booked, the script notifies me via SMS. This allows me to focus on my work or activities without constantly checking for available shifts.

**Note:** I use Firefox for this automation to avoid interfering with my regular browsing. Using a separate browser ensures consistent and uninterrupted script execution.
